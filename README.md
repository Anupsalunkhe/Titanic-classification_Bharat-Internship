Title: Predicting Survival on the Titanic

Objective:
The project aims to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. 
Using machine learning techniques, the model will analyze various passenger features and patterns to classify whether an individual survived the Titanic disaster or not.

Dataset:
The dataset includes a variety of information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, cabin, fare, family relationships, and embarkation point. It contains labeled data indicating whether each passenger survived or perished in the disaster.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will undergo cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to extract meaningful information.
Feature Selection: Identifying significant features that strongly correlate with survival probability.
Model Building: Testing and evaluating different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines to determine the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most reliable model for predicting survival outcomes.
Deliverables:

A trained machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of survival for Titanic passengers.
Evaluation metrics showcasing the performance and accuracy of the model.
Visualizations illustrating key insights and relationships between passenger characteristics and survival rates.
A report summarizing the methodology, findings, and recommendations based on the analysis.
Potential Impact:
The project not only serves as a learning opportunity in machine learning and data analysis but also holds historical significance by exploring the factors that influenced survival rates during one of the most famous maritime disasters in history. 
Additionally, the insights gained may have implications for understanding emergency response and passenger safety in similar scenarios.
